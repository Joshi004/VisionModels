# GPU Cluster Model-Serving API -- Integration Guide

A single asynchronous HTTP API for GPU-cluster model-serving backends on this node. Each backend
(video generation, character replacement in existing video, voice conversion, speech
transcription, and more over time) is namespaced under its own path prefix, but every one of them
shares the same upload, job-submission, and job-tracking endpoints, described once below rather
than once per backend.

**Start here if you're integrating a third-party system against this API:** `GET /v1/guide` (add
`?format=json` for the same content plus machine-readable facts) is this exact document, generated
fresh from this server's own live configuration and `/openapi.json` -- it cannot drift from what
`/docs` shows, and it updates automatically as endpoints change. Re-fetch it (or watch its `ETag`)
when you upgrade your integration, rather than keeping a saved copy of this text.

### Core workflow, in short

1. **Upload any file inputs first**, one at a time: `POST /v1/uploads`. Each call returns an
   `asset_id`; reference that `asset_id` from the generation request that needs it.
2. **Submit a generation request** under the backend's own prefix. Every generation endpoint on
   every backend returns immediately with a `job_id` and `status: "queued"` -- it does **not** wait
   for the result to finish.
3. **Poll `GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}`** every 10-15 seconds until `status` is `"succeeded"` or
   `"failed"`.
4. **Download `GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}/result`** once succeeded.

See "Quickstart" below for a runnable version of this exact flow, and "Jobs and timing" for what to
expect while a job is queued or running.
