"""Parakeet TDT transcription configuration: project paths, accepted input
formats, and this backend's Slurm resource shape.

API-wide settings (host/port, auth, job/upload storage, retention,
partition fallback) live in common/config.py instead -- this module only
has what's specific to the Parakeet project itself.

Zero third-party dependencies (stdlib only), same reasoning as
common/config.py and services/rvc/config.py: nothing here should require
fastapi/uvicorn to be installed.

# project's INPUT_EXTENSIONS for the audio half of this list, confirmed
# there). Video containers (.mp4/.mov/.mkv/.webm/.avi) are accepted too --

# These numbers come from 5 real jobs submitted through this API itself
# (the "verify" step): a 10s clip (two formats of the same recording), a
# 17s video, and a 35-minute audiobook chapter that exercised chunking
# (4 chunks). The 4 that succeeded took 63-117s end to end (queueing +
# node allocation + the run itself), median ~94s -- TYPICAL_RUN_SECONDS
# below is a round number in that range. Model loading, not audio length,
# dominated: the 35-minute chunked file (71s) finished faster than the two
# 10-second clips (117s each) simply because it landed on a node with a
# warmer filesystem cache for the checkpoint -- node-to-node variance
# outweighed the 200x difference in audio duration here. This fallback
# only matters until real job history exists -- server.py's
# _typical_run_seconds already prefers that the moment any exists, and it
# does now.
