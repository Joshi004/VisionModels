"""LTX-2.5-specific configuration: model/checkpoint paths and this backend's
Slurm resource shape.

API-wide settings (host/port, job/upload storage, retention,
partition fallback) live in common/config.py instead -- this module only
has what's specific to the LTX-2.5 project itself.

LTX-2.5 ships as a *split* pack (one .safetensors per component) rather than
LTX-2.3's single fat checkpoint + separate Gemma directory, so every
component below is its own path. It also runs from its own project
directory and its own venv (ltx-2.5/), not LTX-2.3's: the 2.5 code needs a
newer transformers (Gemma 4 text encoder) than 2.3's pinned environment.

Zero third-party dependencies (stdlib only), same reasoning as
common/config.py: nothing here should require fastapi/uvicorn to be
installed.
