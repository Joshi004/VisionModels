"""RVC (via the Applio fork) voice conversion configuration: project paths,
the curated voice registry, and this backend's Slurm resource shape.

API-wide settings (host/port, job/upload storage, retention,
partition fallback) live in common/config.py instead -- this module only
has what's specific to the RVC/Applio project itself.

Zero third-party dependencies (stdlib only), same reasoning as
common/config.py and services/ltx/config.py: nothing here should require
fastapi/uvicorn to be installed.

# two real gaps between Applio's own CLI and what running it as a Slurm job
# needs:
#   1. core.py's own module-level code resolves an internal file
#      (rvc/lib/tools/tts_voices.json) relative to the process's cwd, not
#      its own __file__, so it fails outright unless invoked with Applio's
#      project root as cwd -- a Slurm job doesn't start there by default.
#   2. This deployment's libsndfile (1.2.2, no ffmpeg fallback) can't
#      decode AAC/M4A and other real-world recording formats that Applio's
#      own load_audio_infer()/convert_audio_batch() only ever hand straight
#      to soundfile.read(). Both wrappers decode every input to WAV first
#      (normalize_audio.py's to_wav(), via the ffmpeg binary already
#      bundled in this venv through imageio-ffmpeg -- no system ffmpeg
#      exists on this cluster) before core.py ever sees it.
# See each script's own header comment for the fuller story -- run_batch.py
# also covers two further gaps specific to batch-infer, plus a real naming
# trap (`batch-infer`, hyphenated, differs from its own Python function's

# `core.py infer` itself reported "Conversion completed... in 19.83

# itself) was ~70s. TYPICAL_RUN_SECONDS below is a rough blend of the two
# until real job history accumulates through the API itself (see
