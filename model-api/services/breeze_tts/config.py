"""Breeze TTS 2 (BreezeBlue) text-to-speech configuration: project paths,
accepted reference-audio formats, request limits, and this backend's Slurm
resource shape.

API-wide settings (host/port, job/upload storage, retention, partition
fallback) live in common/config.py instead -- this module only has what's
specific to the Breeze TTS 2 project itself.

Zero third-party dependencies (stdlib only), same reasoning as
services/rvc/config.py: nothing here should require fastapi/uvicorn.
