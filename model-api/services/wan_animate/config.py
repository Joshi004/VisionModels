"""Wan-Animate v1 (Wan2.2-Animate-14B, replace mode) configuration: project
paths and this backend's Slurm resource shape.

API-wide settings (host/port, auth, job/upload storage, retention,
partition fallback) live in common/config.py instead -- this module only
has what's specific to the Wan-Animate v1 project itself.

Zero third-party dependencies (stdlib only), same reasoning as
common/config.py and services/ltx/config.py: nothing here should require
fastapi/uvicorn to be installed.

# RSS, ~74.6 GB peak GPU VRAM (out of 80 GB -- offload_model is on
# automatically for single-GPU jobs, and there isn't a lot of headroom left;
# a much longer or higher-resolution driving video could plausibly OOM). A
# much longer driving video also costs more wall-clock time (the model
# processes it in ~2.5s/77-frame segments, each ~6.5 min to denoise) and may
# need a longer JOB_TIME_LIMIT than this default covers; there's no
# per-request override for that today.
