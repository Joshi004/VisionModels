"""Runs Applio's own `core.py batch-infer` on a folder of input recordings,
then packages every successfully converted file into a single zip -- the
single unit of work model-api's Slurm job submits for a batch conversion --
see model-api/services/rvc/dispatch.py, which builds the argv below, and
model-api/common/run_pipeline_job.py, which actually invokes it on the
compute node (that wrapper owns the partial-path-rename-on-success /
.failed-marker-on-failure convention; this script only needs to write
--output-path and exit non-zero on any real failure).

Four real gaps in `core.py batch-infer` this wrapper exists to paper over
(found by reading rvc/infer/infer.py's VoiceConverter.convert_audio /
convert_audio_batch and rvc/lib/utils.py's load_audio_infer directly, not
assumed) -- plus one real naming trap already hit once while building
this: the click command is registered as `batch-infer` (hyphen), not
`batch_infer` (the Python function's own name, `def batch_infer(...)` in
core.py) -- click rewrites underscores to hyphens in a command's default
name. Confirmed directly against a real `core.py --help` on this cluster
after guessing wrong the first time, not assumed from the function name
alone -- unlike `infer`/`tts` (no underscore to rewrite), this one
actually differs from its Python name.

1. **cwd-relative internal lookup.** Same root cause as run_infer.sh:
   core.py's own module-level code resolves an internal file
   (rvc/lib/tools/tts_voices.json) relative to the process's cwd, not its
   own __file__. Fixed the same way -- invoke core.py with this project's
   own root as cwd, not whatever directory the Slurm job happens to start
   in.
2. **The output folder is never created.** convert_audio_batch() does
   os.listdir(audio_input_paths) (must already exist -- fine, dispatch.py
   creates it) but never touches audio_output_path itself; sf.write()
   into a missing directory raises. Fixed by mkdir'ing it here first.
3. **A failed format conversion doesn't fail the job.** Per file,
   convert_audio() always writes a plain .wav first, then -- only if
   export_format != WAV -- calls convert_audio_format() to also produce
   the requested format. That second step's own exception handling prints
   and swallows any error instead of raising, and its caller
   (convert_audio_batch) never checks convert_audio()'s return value at
   all. Net effect: core.py can exit 0 having silently produced only the
   intermediate .wav for some file, not the format the request actually
   asked for. Fixed here by explicitly verifying one "<stem>_output.<ext>"
   file per input after core.py returns, before declaring success.
4. **No real support for the input formats convert_audio_batch() claims to
   accept.** Its own os.listdir() filter matches .m4a/.mp4/.aac/.wma/
   .webm/.ac3/... by extension, but every actual read goes through
   soundfile.read() (load_audio_infer(), rvc/lib/utils.py) -- and this
   deployment's libsndfile (1.2.2) can only decode WAV/MP3/FLAC/OGG/Opus/
   AIFF, not AAC/M4A or the rest. A real iPhone-recorded .m4a voice note
   uploaded through this API failed outright on exactly this gap. Fixed by
   decoding every input file to WAV first (normalize_audio.py's to_wav(),
   using the ffmpeg binary already bundled in this project's own venv via
   imageio-ffmpeg -- no system ffmpeg exists on this cluster) into a
   separate --work-folder, then pointing batch-infer at that folder
   instead of the caller's original one.

Must be run with *Applio's own* venv interpreter (RVC_PYTHON in
model-api/services/rvc/config.py, i.e. ModelService_RVC-Applio/.venv/bin/
python) -- both core.py and this script's own normalize_audio import
(which needs imageio-ffmpeg) only exist there.

Usage:
    run_batch.py --input-folder DIR --work-folder DIR --output-folder DIR \\
        --output-path ZIP --export-format FMT \\
        [any other `core.py batch-infer` flag ...]

--input-folder   Folder of input recordings to convert (already populated
                  by the caller -- this script only reads it; may be a
                  folder of symlinks to real files elsewhere, see
                  model-api/services/rvc/dispatch.py's _symlink_inputs).
--work-folder    Folder this script decodes a WAV copy of every input file
                  into (created here if missing) -- what's actually passed
                  to `core.py batch-infer` as --input-folder. Kept separate
                  from --input-folder itself since that folder may only
                  contain symlinks this script shouldn't write into.
--output-folder  Folder Applio itself writes its per-file outputs into
                  (created here if missing; not cleaned up afterwards --
                  the caller owns this directory's lifecycle, same as
                  run_replace.py's --work-dir).
--output-path    Final zip path to write. Written directly (this script
                  does not do its own "partial" renaming -- see
                  run_pipeline_job.py). Not a `core.py batch-infer` flag --
                  read here, not forwarded.
--export-format  Forwarded to `core.py batch-infer` unchanged, and also
                  used here to know which output extension to verify/zip.

Every other flag (--pth-path, --index-path, --pitch, --f0-method, ...) is
forwarded to `core.py batch-infer` verbatim, in its original order --
this script only needs to intercept the five flags above.

Exit code 0 only if --output-path was actually written with one converted
file per input inside it; non-zero on any failure (an undecodable input, a
non-zero exit from `batch-infer` itself, a missing expected output, or a
failed zip write).
